## 🎨 Simulation Architecture

### Game Engine (`game_engine.py`)
The core simulation engine processes StatsBomb events and generates smooth animations:

#### Key Components:
- **Event Timeline**: Chronological processing of passes, shots, tackles
- **Position Interpolation**: Smooth movement between freeze frames
- **Tactical Positioning**: Dynamic formations based on ball location
  - Teams push forward when attacking
  - Teams drop back when defending
  - Players maintain formation shape
- **Hybrid Movement System**:
  - Uses real tracking data when available (freeze frames)
  - Blends to tactical positions during sparse data gaps
  - Adds subtle "idle noise" to prevent static appearance

#### Performance Optimizations:
- **O(1) player metadata cache** (eliminates per-frame lookups)
- **Collision detection** for overlapping default positions
- **Smooth Hermite interpolation** for natural acceleration/deceleration

### Renderer (`renderer.py`)
Pygame-based UI with three main views:

1. **Menu Screen**: Competition/Season/Team selection with scrollable dropdowns
2. **Simulation View**: 
   - Top bar: Score, match time, period
   - Left sidebar: Controls guide, match info
   - Center: Animated pitch with players and ball
   - Right panel: Selected player statistics
   - Bottom: Playback controls and seek bar
3. **Stats Panel**: Real-time tracking of touches, passes, shots, tackles

### Data Loader (`data_loader.py`)
- Fetches StatsBomb open data via HTTP
- Uses **kloppy** for standardized coordinate systems
- Caches match data locally to avoid repeated downloads
- Extracts player metadata (jersey numbers, positions, teams)

Expected = 1 / (1 + 10^((Elo_B - Elo_A) / 400))
New_Elo = Old_Elo + K * (Actual - Expected)
```

#### Hermite Interpolation
```python
t_smooth = 3t² - 2t³  # Ease-in-out curve
position = start + (end - start) * t_smooth
```

#### Tactical Position Calculation
```python
# Teams shift based on ball position
if ball_x > 60:  # Ball in attacking half
    shift_forward = (ball_x - 60) * 0.3
else:  # Ball in defensive half
    shift_back = (60 - ball_x) * 0.2
```
